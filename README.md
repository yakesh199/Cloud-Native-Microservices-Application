# Cloud-Native Microservices Application (AWS)

## Overview
The **Cloud-Native Microservices Application (AWS)** demonstrates proficiency in building scalable, cloud-native applications using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the underlying infrastructure.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), including EC2, Lambda, S3, etc.
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend Development**: Node.js with custom AWS-specific modules (e.g., `aws.ts`, `index.ts`, `pty.ts`)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS-specific configurations, potentially using CloudFormation or Terraform
- **Package Management**: npm, Yarn

## Key Features
- **AWS Integration**: Leverages AWS services for a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **TypeScript Codebase**: Entirely written in TypeScript, benefiting from static typing and rich tooling.
- **Custom Backend Logic**: Includes TypeScript files implementing business logic and AWS service interactions.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Defines and manages cloud infrastructure programmatically.

## Deployment and Setup
To deploy and run the **Cloud-Native Microservices Application (AWS)**:

1. Set up the necessary AWS resources and configurations.
2. Install dependencies using `npm` or `Yarn`.
3. Build and package the application for deployment.
4. Manage the application's lifecycle, including scaling, monitoring, and maintenance within the AWS ecosystem.

# Cloud-Native Microservices Application (AWS + Kubernetes + Docker)

## Overview
The **Cloud-Native Microservices Application (AWS + Kubernetes + Docker)** is an advanced version that leverages Kubernetes to manage deployment and scaling, showcasing expertise in modern, scalable cloud-native applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Container Platform**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend Development**: Node.js with custom application code
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Kubernetes YAML configurations
- **Package Management**: npm, Yarn

## Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designed with separate services (e.g., `init-service`, `orchestrator-simple`, `runner`).
- **Containerization and Kubernetes**: Dockerized application deployed with Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managed with Kubernetes manifests for streamlined infrastructure configuration.
- **TypeScript Codebase**: Written in TypeScript, benefiting from type safety.
- **Best Practices**: Follows cloud-native best practices like health checks, liveness, and readiness probes.

## Deployment and Setup
To deploy and run the **Cloud-Native Microservices Application (AWS + Kubernetes + Docker)**:

1. Set up the necessary AWS resources and Kubernetes cluster.
2. Configure the Kubernetes manifests and apply them to the cluster.
3. Install dependencies using `npm` or `Yarn`.
4. Build and deploy Docker images to the Kubernetes cluster.
5. Monitor and manage the application within Kubernetes.
