Cloud-Native Microservices Application
AWS Version
Overview
The Medium version of the Cloud-Native Microservices Application is a project that demonstrates your proficiency in building a cloud-native application leveraging AWS services. This iteration focuses on integrating various AWS offerings to create a scalable and reliable backend infrastructure.
Technologies Used

Cloud Infrastructure: Amazon Web Services (AWS), including services such as EC2, Lambda, S3, etc.
Programming Language: TypeScript
Backend Development: Node.js, custom AWS-specific modules (e.g., aws.ts, index.ts, pty.ts)
Infrastructure as Code: AWS-specific configurations, potentially using services like CloudFormation or Terraform
Package Management: npm, Yarn

Key Features

AWS Integration: The application seamlessly integrates with various AWS services to provide a robust and scalable cloud-based infrastructure. This includes leveraging compute, storage, and serverless offerings to power the backend components.
TypeScript Codebase: The project is entirely written in TypeScript, showcasing your ability to leverage the benefits of static typing and the rich tooling ecosystem around the language.
Custom Backend Logic: The codebase includes TypeScript files that implement custom business logic and interact with the underlying AWS services.
Infrastructure as Code: The project demonstrates your skills in defining and managing the cloud infrastructure programmatically, using AWS-specific configuration files and tools.

Deployment and Setup
To deploy and run the Medium version of the Cloud-Native Microservices Application, you will need to:

Set up the necessary AWS resources and configurations.
Install the required dependencies using npm or Yarn.
Build and package the application for deployment on the AWS infrastructure.
Manage the application's lifecycle, including scaling, monitoring, and maintenance, within the AWS ecosystem.

Advanced Version
Overview
The Advanced version of the Cloud-Native Microservices Application showcases your expertise in building modern, scalable, and highly available cloud-native applications. This iteration leverages Kubernetes, a leading container orchestration platform, to manage the deployment and scaling of the microservices-based architecture.
Technologies Used

Cloud Infrastructure: Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the underlying cloud resources
Container Platform: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration
Programming Language: TypeScript
Backend Development: Node.js, custom application code
Infrastructure as Code: Kubernetes YAML configurations
Package Management: npm, Yarn

Key Features

Microservices Architecture: The application is designed using a microservices approach, with separate service components for different functionalities (e.g., init-service, orchestrator-simple, runner).
Containerization and Kubernetes: The application is packaged as Docker containers and deployed using Kubernetes, enabling scalability, high availability, and easy management of the cloud infrastructure.
Infrastructure as Code with Kubernetes: The project utilizes YAML configuration files to define and manage the Kubernetes resources, demonstrating your skills in infrastructure as code practices.
TypeScript Codebase: Similar to the Medium version, the Advanced version is written in TypeScript, leveraging its type safety and tooling benefits.
Best Practices: The project follows industry-standard best practices for cloud-native development, such as using health checks, readiness and liveness probes, and other Kubernetes-specific configurations to ensure the application's reliability and maintainability.

Deployment and Setup
To deploy and run the Advanced version of the Cloud-Native Microservices Application, you will need to:

Set up the necessary AWS resources and Kubernetes cluster.
Configure the Kubernetes manifests and apply them to the cluster.
Install the required dependencies using npm or Yarn.
Build and package the application Docker images.
Deploy the containerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.
Monitor and manage the application's lifecycle within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Comparison of Versions
The two versions of the Cloud-Native Microservices Application showcase your growth and mastery of cloud-native development practices:

Medium Version: Demonstrates your ability to leverage AWS services to build a scalable, cloud-based application. This version focuses on integrating with AWS offerings and managing the infrastructure programmatically.
Advanced Version: Exhibits your proficiency in modern cloud-native technologies, including containerization, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code using Kubernetes manifests. This version follows industry-standard best practices for building highly available, reliable, and maintainable microservices-based applications.Cloud-Native Microservices Application
